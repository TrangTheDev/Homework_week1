## Homework task - Refactoring
Students are required to improve the structure of the code base by replacing the semantic and applying comments before each element or section  
Students are required to improve efficiency of the CSS by consolidating any duplications of selectors and properties  
Use **accessibility** guidelines to meet standards  
The website should not change visually, after the code has been updated with the changes made  

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
